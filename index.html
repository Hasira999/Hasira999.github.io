			<h5> About </h5>
			<p> Started learning about front-end web dev and thought this to be a perfect place to start. I know this sounds weird and cliche but you really helped me 
			turn my life around. Trust me these aren't just empty words and I don't say this to every girl who makes me feel this way, so yeah you're really special
			in that regard. Anyways, even though I've got plenty more to say about stuff related to this, I know you probably won't care about this and you prolly 
			won't feel the same way about me ( mainly cos of u-know-who ) and it is pretty normal as well as you haven't known me before this, like, at all and it is 
			and unlike me "normal" humans don't get hooked like this I suppose hehe. Anways enough sadistic talk, ( I know I'm a train-wreck lol ) have the best 
			b'day Hansali and I hope that we can be friends and are able to hang-out at some point ( trust me I'll be counting the days till we hang-out ). </p>
			
			<p> Love you ( the kind of love u find in friends and what not, don't wanna come out as a creep ( even though I prolly already have :(( ) ), always <3 </p>
