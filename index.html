		<div>
            <p> Hey Hansali, it's that weirdo again. How have you been ? </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                I know that you have been ignoring me, and there's absolutely 1000+ reasons for you to ignore me so no offence taken.
            </p>
            <br>  
            <p>
                As far as I know it was the tiktok I sent that made u hate me, the one where I termed myself a guy who is " persistent ", well it was all in good fun and 
                I didn't really mean it, I know it sounds like I am just apologizing again like I did after every time I fucked up things with you, just to fuck things up with 
                you again in a week or so. And I am sorry for making you feel any type of way bad about yourself for entertaining a dude who is just trying to cause havoc 
                in ur life.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
               I know this seems bizarre and stupid and fucked up to the maximum ( least that's the way I feel ). Like how can you fall so fucking hard for a girl you have
               talked with for approx 15 minutes whilst getting ur hand low key burnt over some stupid fire while u roast some shrimp on the barbie ( well there wasn't really 
               any shrimp in there but, I had to use that phrase for shits and gags)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                But honestly, I did fall hard. I fell so hard that I started having 2 way convos with "you" and myself ( both ends narrated by me ofc ). It wasn't anything related 
                to sex either, it was just normal day-to-day talk, well I have to admit that cos it was all in my head I made u in my head appear slightly more attracted 
                to me lel.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                Ur name appearing on my phone gave me so much joy. Alright enough with the cliche stuff ( but it did really happen ). Oh and 1 more thing. Yaknow the facebook
                stories ? Yeah, only u can view them so I am not a lunatic ( u just made a whole webpage for her Hasira, u are a lunatic fool ) .
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Alright, now let me tell you what I really want you to grasp from this whole thing. I would legitimately die for you, idk why, idk wtf is wrong with me 
                but there u go. U heard ( read ) it from me itself. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now the second thing I want you to grasp from this is, this is my 6th month in and still my feelings are as 
                they were on January, I know you do not want absolutely anything to do with me, and I know that u wouldn't care if I was dead on the streets ( was a tough couple
                of months but I realised that eventually - the truth is indeed bitter ).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And the final thing I want you to understand is, that it is alright for you to actually
                not care, and rightfully so, u don't even know me properly, and the inital impression I gave off is not that good, I know. Heck you prolly think it's better
                to stay away from this psycho after reading all this.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Well now that I have poured my heart out for good measure, I think it is time to finally move on. This may seem like simping. I hate that word. A woman
                should be treated properly, and that should not be shamed upon. Doesn't matter, kids these days, idc. Anyway, all that you have to know is that ur probably the only
                girl in the world who received something like this. I won't get into the technical details of how I made this work but. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <P>
                Anyway Hansali, now that I have said what I have to say, just know that if you ever need me, I'll be right there. Whether it is to offer you any help
                or if it is to take care of you or to hold ur hair while ur throwing up into the toilet.
            </P>
            <br>
            <p>
                I just said what I had crowded up in my mind for the past few weeks. I wouldve sent this to you sooner but coudnt risk fucking up finals.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have 1 thing to ask you though. Please don't make this something I regret doing when I look back at it at a future point. i.e please keep this between 
                just the two of us. I would appreciate it so much if you could. heck, u can tell it to ur kids tho, tell them of the story of how that 1 lunatic from
                ur past created some webpage just cos he didnt have anything else to do.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                On a final note, I'll leave you alone from now on. You have my word. But please x3 keep this just between the 2 of us. I don't really care if this gets 
                out or whatever, I just said what's in my mind, and I don't think I hurt u in anyway after saying all this so yeah.

                honestly, most people would just let this grow old with time, guess im not most people
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                honestly I didnt modify this in any sort of way, just made my fingers move over the keys with the thoughts in my head. please send a skull emoji
                if u made it this far, thanks.
            </p>
