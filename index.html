			<p> Let me walk you through the process of how I got the photo so u won't have to worry of some random Joe getting it like this ( wait am I a random Joe :(( ? ) </p>
			
			<p> So, I basically went to ur research gate website right, then I right-clicked on the page, selected "View Page Source" and then looked through the source code 
			of the webpage. The source code is like rows upon rows of code so if u don't have the knowledge to interpret it, it's basically greek. Then I looked through the source
			code ( which consisted of around 500 lines lol ) till I saw a .jpg file extension with ur name in it and voila it was ur face, then I linked it via HTML to this web page
			which u are viewing right now :)) You can prolly try it yourself, if ur on a lap/desktop, right click anywhere on the whitespace and select "View page source". 
			( uhh, this might be really fucking weird to you, but just know that I used the photo only for this webpage's purpose,
			I swear on that. ) </p>

			<h5> About </h5>
			<p> Started learning about front-end web dev and thought this to be a perfect place to start. I know this sounds weird and cliche but you really helped me 
			turn my life around. Trust me these aren't just empty words and I don't say this to every girl who makes me feel this way, so yeah you're really special
			in that regard. Anyways, even though I've got plenty more to say about stuff related to this, I know you probably won't care about this and you prolly 
			won't feel the same way about me ( mainly cos of u-know-who ) and it is pretty normal as well as you haven't known me before this, like, at all and it is 
			and unlike me "normal" humans don't get hooked like this I suppose hehe. Anways enough sadistic talk, ( I know I'm a train-wreck lol ) have the best 
			b'day Hansali and I hope that we can be friends and are able to hang out and talk irl at some point ( trust me I'll be counting the days till we hang out ). </p>
			
			<p> Love you ( the kind of love u find in friends and what not, don't wanna come out as a creep ( even though I prolly already have :(( ) ), always <3 </p>
