                STUDENT GUARDIAN VISA - SUBCLASS 590
            </h2>

            <p>Any person who is coming to Australia as an overseas student should be accompanied by a guardian if they are under 18 years of age. Student Guardians are either:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the parent of the student visa holder</li>
                <li>a person who has custody of the student</li>
                <li>a relative of the student, aged 21 years or older, nominated in writing by a parent or person who has the custody of the student.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If the person coming on a student visa has a relative who lives in Australia, they can be nominated by a parent or person who has the custody of the student.</p>
            <p>The Student Guardian Visas are generally granted until the student becomes 18 years of age. They are supposed to live with the student and do not have work rights.</p>
