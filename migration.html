                    <h2>Work Restrictions waived for International Nursing Students</h2> 
                    <p> Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, announced drastic measures to overcome healthcare staff shortage in hospitals. </p>
                    <p>Work restrictions would be lifted on some 20,000 international nursing students currently studying in Australia. They are going to be available to support the health effort right across the country, as directed by Australian Health Officials. Australia is not importing nurses into the country. This technically means that they will have unlimited work rights instead of the 40 hour fortnightly work limitation.

                    <p>If you are in Australia on a visitor visa, your visa allows you to be in Australia for 3, 6 or 12 months </p>
                    <p>Please ensure that you do not overstay your visa. There are systems in place for visitors onshore to apply for a further visa, to make their status lawful.</p>
                    <p>This is very important if their visa has a no further stay condition 8503 on their visa grant. </p>
                    <p>This condition precludes those visa holders applying for a further visa while they are onshore, except for certain prescribed visa categories. It is advisable to obtain appropriate immigration advise to resolve their visa status.</p>

                    <p> Quoted - ""All students who came to Australia in their first year, have to give a warranty that they are able to support themselves, in the first twelve months of their study. That is a requirement of their visa when they came for their first year. That is not an unreasonable expectation of the government, that students would be able to fulfill the commitment they gave. These visas and those who are in Australia, they are obviously not held here compulsorily, if they are not in a position to be able to support themselves. Then there is the alternative for them to return to their home countries. At this time, Australia must focus on their citizens and residents."<br>

                    <!-- link youtube video here -->
                    <p> This was a radio interview I had a few years ago, but the information is still current except for the planned changes. The changes were never implemented. As it stands today, it is still necessary to lodge the visa application first and then the sponsorship application afterwards.</p>
                    <p> The discussion focuses on threshold requirements to lodge a Partner Visa application, that the process is a two stage application process </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Provisional Visa, and after two years of lodging the application </li>
                        <li> Permanent Visa</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The video also discloses what happens if the relationship breaks down before the permanent visa has been granted. </p>  
                    <p> This also discusses the consequences of family violence. </p>
